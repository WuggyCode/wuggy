# LD1NN Examples

## Evaluating Wuggy Pseudowords

LD1NN is perfectly suitable for evaluating pseudowords generated by Wuggy. The following code snippet describes a fictional experiment in which we want to create ten pseudowords for ten real English words and evaluate them using LD1NN to see if we find a word bias.

```python
from wuggy import WuggyGenerator, ld1nn

g = WuggyGenerator()
g.load("orthographic_english")
words = ["rats", "rave", "rays", "raze", "read", "real", "ream", "reap", "rear", "road"]
pseudowords = []
for w in g.generate_classic(words, ncandidates_per_sequence=1):
    pseudowords.append(w["pseudoword"])

print(f"Pseudowords used: {pseudowords}")
print(ld1nn(words, pseudowords))
```

Below is an example result from the script:

`
Pseudowords used: ['sats', 'rane', 'tays', 'rask', 'sead', 'reot', 'reem', 'seap', 'reer', 'roud']
{'odds': 1.0838804106503954, 'standard_error': 0.16781712105679011, 'P>|z|': 0.8667271528642492}
`

In this case, the word bias is low: 1.08 is very close to 1 (where 1 indicates no word bias). However, due to the small sample size this result is insignificant as the P value is at 0.8. Of course, a real experiment relies on larger samples where a significant result is more realistic. This is also where LD1NN becomes the most useful. For large samples, it becomes extremely difficult to manually assess word bias. LD1NN can help by providing a fast way to determine word bias, even for very large samples.
